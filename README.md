# Automatically-fill
1.What the project does
Run the Tianxuenet software on the Xiaoyao Android simulator, and automatically fill in the answers of English listening on the premise of having answers.

2.Why this project is created
What's interesting is that I do all the things just because I can't fill in a little part of answer and then go on to fill in the next part,the app is designed to prevent students quickly fill in the answers you got from your classmates.

3.How to get started with the project
Most importantly,we need the answer of the English listening test(for example,I got this from my schoolmates who had finished this homework),and put these information in "keywords_list.txt"
And then a VirtualBox Android is needed ,and run TianXuewang on it,and start a listening test.
The last step is to run the main.py .
